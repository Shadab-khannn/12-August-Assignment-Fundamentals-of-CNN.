    "Object detection and object classification are two important tasks in computer vision that involve analyzing and understanding visual data.\n",
    "Object detection is the task of identifying and localizing objects within an image or video.\n",
    "It goes beyond classification by not only determining what objects are present but also precisely locating them within the visual data.\n",
    "Object detection combines the power of classification and localization. The process of object detection involves two key steps: classification\n",
    "and localization. In the classification step, a machine learning model is trained to recognize different classes or categories of objects.\n",
    "This training enables the model to assign labels to objects based on their visual characteristics. In the localization step, the model uses\n",
    "bounding boxes to specify the precise location of each detected object within the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification, on the other hand, focuses on assigning a label or category to an entire image or a specific region within the image. \n",
    "It determines the presence or absence of specific objects or classes in the visual data.\n",
    "In image classification, a model is trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and features associated with different classes.\n",
    "Once trained, the model can predict the class label of an unseen image by analyzing its visual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these concepts, consider an example where you want to detect and classify different types of fruits in an image.\n",
    "Object detection would involve identifying each fruit in the image and precisely locating it using bounding boxes. \n",
    "Object classification would involve assigning a label or category to each fruit based on its visual characteristics."
